= RESTFlux 
:docs: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference

This is a test creating a REST Client using Spring WebFlux.

== What You'll Build

Youâ€™ll test a RESTful WebClient consumer. 
Additionally Spring Boot Actuator is enabled in order to monitor and interact with your application.
You'll be able to see output in both System.out and at:
http://localhost:9090/results
http://localhost:9090/actuator

== What You'll Need

:java_version: 1.8

== Create(Simulate) a Reactive Result Repository

The repository is based on WebClient for retrieving results from rest service.

`src/main/java/com/gamonsoft/restflux/service/ResultRepository.java`
== Create a Controller

The controller is using ReactiveDataDriverContextVariable for enabling a reactive behavior.

`src/main/java/com/gamonsoft/restflux/controller/ResultController.java`

== Create Thymeleaf templates

Views also support reactive communication.

`src/main/resources/templates`

== Make the Application Executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional
link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server,
the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package
everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method.
Along the way, you use Reactive Spring's support for embedding the Netty server as the
HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.

Docker configuration file is also provided.

`src/main/java/com/gamonsoft/restflux/Application.java`
[source,java]

== Test the Application

Now that the application is running, you can test it. To start with, you can open a
browser and go to `http://localhost:9090/results`.

== Summary

Congratulations! You have tested a WebClient to consume a RESTful service!
